A basic python gui program with concepts of OOP and modules of tkinter and tqdm. 
It is a very new project and has lots of errors and bugs.(No exception handled till now)
The progressbar is also not working.
I'm making this for hacktoberfest. All open source newbies can contribute and earn a t-shirt
